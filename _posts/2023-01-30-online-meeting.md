The topic of the meeting was a discussion about the theoretical analysis of eqiuvariant autoencoders.
The discussion was led by KTH student Vahid Shahverdi, who first gave an introduction to algebraic geometry, how it relates to machine learning research, and how these methods can be used to analyse properties of equivariant autoencoders.
Additionally, the project members started planning the in-person meetings for 2023 and how to continue collaboration in joint research efforts.
