The April project meeting, was focused on planning the in-person meeting in May. Additonally, PhD student Marcel BÃ¼sching from KTH gave a presentation on Generalisable Neural rendering.

Generalisable Neural Rendering methods such IBRNet (Wang et al., CVPR 2023) and GNT (Varma T. et al., ICLR 2023) are not trained on a single scene as most current methods such as NeRF (Mildenhall et al., ECCV 2020), but rather across serveral different scenes.
These models therfore have a general understanding on how to aggregate information from source images and how to use this information to render novel views of the observed scene.
